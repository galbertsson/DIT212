# Meeting Agenda
Group: OhiMarc
Date: 2018-09-04
Chair: Gustav Albertsson
Participants: Thomas Li, Gustav Albertsson, Alexander Sandberg, Victor Johansson, Mathias Forsman

## Objectives (5 min)
Agree on what to do for our project.
Come up with ideas for a project and decide one.

## Reports (15 min) from previous meeting
This is the first meeting, therefore this section is empty.

## Discussion items (35 min)
To discuss: What kind of project are we going to do during this course? Would we like to create a mobile application or an application for a desktop? What different sorts of projects would be best fitted for the purposes of this course?

## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
We have decided on a preliminary idea for what kind of project we want to do. We want to create an smartphone app that would help people study with the help of flashcards, similar to the app “Cram”. The idea is that this app could later be expanded with more features to get variation in the learning methods. For example, the user could also make and use quizzes with generate answer alternatives or include game-like elements for more variation. The app could also have some in-app rewards when the user finish exercises to get the user more interested and help create routine use of the app for the users.

We have set up a repository on GitHub and have given all group members access.

## Wrap up
We haven't gotten the teaching assistant's approval of the project, since we haven't met him yet.

During the next meeting we want to get a better idea of what we want to do, begin designing the GUI and make user stories.   

The next planned meeting will be some time after we have had a meeting with the teaching assistant (Thursday or Friday this week).
