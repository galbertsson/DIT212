   1. The color scheme will be exported from the tool as an XML file to smoothly be integrated into the project.
1. There is some work that needs to be done, that user stories don’t exist for yet. The group decided on implementing/adjusting user stories for the following features:
   1. The side menu bar, with its elements and functionality, needs to be implemented and needs a user story.
   2. User story #11 addresses user profiles, but doesn’t cover that a user might want to logout and change profile in-app, without restarting. The acceptance criteria needs to be adjusted to address this.

   1. Regarding the content of the SDD, the group members should check the template on the course page
