# Meeting Agenda
Group: OhiMarc
Date: 2018-09-17
Chair: Gustav Albertsson
Participants: Thomas Li, Gustav Albertsson, Alexander Sandberg, Victor Johansson

## Objectives (5 min)
We want to discuss how we will get something runnable till Friday.
We want to discuss the rewriting of the user stories using the template.


## Reports (15 min) 
Since the last meeting:
* A user story (user story #3) has been revised. It no longer has “5 cards” as a requirement, and instead has “a number of cards”, to better fit a reasonable user perspective. (Thomas, Alexander)
* The domain model has had the main class name changed from “FlashcardTrainingTool” to “MemorizationTrainingTool”. (Gustav)
* A diagram of the domain model with adjusted class names for the 2018-09-18 seminar has been created. (Gustav, Thomas)
* A presentation has been created for the 2018-09-18 seminar. (Victor)
* A user story (user story #2) has been revised with a new motivation for the user story.


## Discussion items (35 min)
1. Discuss how we are going to get something runnable until Friday and who will do what. Decide what steps need to be taken, and assign tasks to group members.
2. Discuss how we are going to rewrite the user stories according to the template.


## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
Outcomes:
* Regarding getting the application up and running, the group decided on setting tasks to accomplish (given in “Assignments”). The normal procedure should be followed when accomplishing these steps (testing etc.).
* “Getting the application up and running” in our case sets the initial goal to fulfill user story #1 in the RAD, as well as code the entire domain model (barebones, getting all the classes up).
   * TravisCI needs to be set up on our project repository.
   * The main view the user sees and interacts with should be finished.
      * “Game” logic should exist for toggling text on the one hardcoded card.
      * The proper model for storing and handling the card should be implemented (one card in one deck)
      * The view should properly show information from the card and react to user interaction (tapping the card)
   * Minimum classes from the domain model should be created, to sufficiently represent the domain model.
