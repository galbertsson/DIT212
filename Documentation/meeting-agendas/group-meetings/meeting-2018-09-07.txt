Chair: Gustav Albertsson
Participants: Thomas Li, Gustav Albertsson, Alexander Sandberg, Victor Johansson, Mathias Forsman

## Objectives (5 min)
Discuss and sketch the GUI and interactions.
Write user stories for our project. 

## Reports (15 min) from previous meeting
We have talked to our TA, where we decided that we would like to develop a mobile application called Marc. Marc will be an application that helps the user with learning different subjects, using flashcards and quizzes. 

## Discussion items (35 min)
1. Discuss the GUI of our application.
   1. What screens should be available in our application?
   2. How should the screens look like?
   3. How should the screens interact with one another?

2. Discuss the user stories for our project.
   1. Discuss, write and add user stories that are useful for our project.

## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
Outcomes:
1. Discuss the GUI of our application.
   1. Images of the screens that were decided on will be available on the GitHub repository. All the screens are what is needed for the features that we could think of at the moment.
   2. The group decided on a visually simple design in the Material Design style, with menu elements trying to adhere somewhat to Android standards (regarding menu bars, side menus, etc.). Some design choices were also inspired by the “Cram” app, in terms of more app-specific design choices, as in the overall look of app features. 
   3. How the screens interact with each other will be described visually through the images on the GitHub repository.
2. Write user stories.
   1. We were not able to start working on our user stories within our scope of time during this meeting. This assignment will be postponed until the next meeting.

Assignments: 
1. Create the base of the project (Thomas, Gustav, Alexander)
   1. Construct the base of the project in android studios.
   2. Push the project to master on GitHub, making it accessible for all group members.
2. Share the sketched screens of our application (Victor, Mathias)
   1. Construct a representable picture that includes all of our sketched screens, where the interaction between each screen should be clear.
   2. Push the final construction to master on GitHub.

## Wrap up
A GUI was sketched, where the basic visual representation, and interaction between the screens, was decided upon.
User stories was not discussed this meeting.
The next meeting will be on Monday at 13:15
