# Meeting Agenda
Group: OhiMarc
Date: 2018-09-10
Chair: Thomas Li
Participants: Thomas Li, Gustav Albertsson, Alexander Sandberg, Victor Johansson, Mathias Forsman

## Objectives (5 min)
* We want to decide when we are going to write the first part of the RAD document.
* We want to discuss user stories and how to manage them.
* We want to ensure that the template project builds on all group member’s computers.


## Reports (15 min) from previous meeting
Thomas, Gustav and Alexander have:
Created the base of the project which is now pushed to GitHub, they also added a suitable gitignore file to make development easier and reduce clutter in the repository.


Victor and Mathias have:
Combined the sketches that was drawn the last meeting to make them easier to handle.


## Discussion items (35 min)
1. Decide on a service for managing our user stories.
2. Decide on a time for writing our user stories. This will need discussion between all members and should include the entire group.
3. Decide on a time for writing the RAD. This will need discussion between all members and should include the entire group.


## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
Outcomes:
1. We decided on using Trello to manage our user stories during development. Since user stories will be written down both in the RAD and on the Trello board, we decided that the RAD document will have priority over Trello when adding/editing user stories. Any changes that are done to the user stories has to be done first in the RAD document and only after in Trello. This will help keep the user stories in the RAD and Trello board in sync and consistent. 
2. We decided on writing the user stories down as soon as possible, to get a clear view of what our application should do and what requirements it has.
3. We decided on starting work on the RAD introduction as soon as the user stories are finished. The user stories should serve as a basis for writing the RAD introduction.


Assignments: 
* The group will meet to write the user stories as soon as possible, after the conclusion of the meeting, 2018-09-10.
* This Wednesday (2018-09-12) the whole group will be gathered to work on the RAD, starting at 15:00. 
* All members should make sure that they can successfully clone the template application from the project repository, and successfully build it in Android studio.
* If there is time, the group will start working on the UML for our project, which is included in the RAD. 


## Wrap up
The next meeting will be on Friday 2018-09-14 at 13:00
