# Meeting Agenda
Group: OhiMarc
Date: 2018-09-24
Chair: Mathias Forsman
Participants: Thomas Li, Gustav Albertsson, Alexander Sandberg, Victor Johansson, Mathias Forsman

## Objectives (5 min)
Discuss the composition and relations for the new Note class in our domain model.
Discuss current user stories based on the changes of the domain model.
Discuss current user stories’ nonfunctional and functional requirements.

## Reports (15 min) 
* The group has had a discussion regarding the domain model and the critique from the last seminar. A new proposition for a better and more feature-rich has been agreed on. A diagram of the new domain model will be put in the updated RAD. 
* All members read up on the MVP design principle.
* We reworked our project, from MVC to MVP, which should make our project more maintainable.


## Discussion items (35 min)
1. How should our Note class look like?
   1.1. What should the Note class be used for?
   1.2. Should there be a class hierarchy for Note?
   1.3. Should it be a single class?
   1.4. How should it be connected to our other classes in the domain model?
2. How should we rework our user stories, based on our new domain model?
3. Discuss whether or not we’ve assigned our user stories correctly, when it comes to functional or nonfunctional requirements.


## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
Outcomes:
1. Regarding the new Note class:
   1.1. The Note class should be used for creating cards, which provides more functionality for our users.
   1.2. Yes, Note will have a class hierarchy. Note will be an abstract class, where “ClozeNote” and “BasicNote” will be subclasses.
   1.3. No, see the answer above.
   1.4. Decks should consist of Notes, which creates Cards for the Deck. Decks “have” Notes, and Notes “have” Cards.
2. We need to write new user stories to accommodate the new classes, as well as modify some existing user stories.
   2.1. The existing user stories that will need to be adjusted are (7, 9, 10)
   2.2. New user stories will need to be added in addition to these to take into account the User (and related content, such as Stats) and Note class.
3. We will need to read the book (Domain-Driven Design, available on the course page) to get a better understanding of the differentiating factors between functional and nonfunctional acceptance criteria. Ayberk provided some insight to this during the last TA meeting, but we should make sure to back our decisions up with more knowledge.


Assignments: 
* Rewrite, and add, user stories. (Everyone)
* Read up on domain models in the book. (Everyone)
* Read up on functional and nonfunctional requirements in the book. (Everyone)
* Continue working on the user stories that were assigned to the group during the last meeting. (Everyone)
