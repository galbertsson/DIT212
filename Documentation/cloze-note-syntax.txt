The syntax for cloze notes are:
A cloze deletion is marked by [[a::word]] where "a" is the cloze identifier and "word" is the word that is going to be replaced.

For example:
"Hello [[a::world]]"

Generates a card where the front is "Hello [..]" and the back is "Hello world".

It also supports multiple deletions such as:
"Hello [[a::Alice]], where is [[a::Bob]]"

will generate a card where the front is "Hello [..], where is [..]" and the back is "Hello Alice, where is Bob".


It also supports multiple clozes in the same note:
"Hello [[a::Alice]], where is [[b::Bob]]"

will generate 2 cards:
the first card front is "Hello [..], where is Bob"
the first card back is "Hello Alice, where is Bob"

the second card front is "Hello Alice, where is [..]"
the second card back is "Hello Alice, where is Bob"
